    "comment": "I am cognizant of the fact we need a NCL, and failing to implement one risks stalling the progress of Cardano altogether. I also hope that, if this vote fails to pass, we can have a new vote with a less ambitious NCL target in quick succession. I’m not convinced about allocating almost the entire treasury inflow to the annual budget. It’s a risky move that could have serious financial consequences for the Treasury in the long run. The total operational budget for Catalyst in 2025 (including F14, F15, and F16) hasn’t even reached 100 million ADA. I’d vote yes with an annual budget expenditure that doesn’t exceed 50% of the total inflow."
